# arbit/downloader

## Setup

We're going to need to create a VM to run the download.  The f1-micro costs $3.88 a month with the sustained use discount, so it's unlikely to break the bank.  Spin one of those up from the cloud shell with the command:

    gcloud compute instances create downloader-edgar \
      --zone us-east1-b \
      --machine-type f1-micro

We're probably going to need to size the machine up to run all the downloaders...

Your environment is woefully inadequate.  To fix it do this:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt -y upgrade
    sudo apt -y install git-all
    sudo apt -y install python3 python3-dev python3-pip
    pip3 install --upgrade google-cloud
    git clone https://github.com/benofben/arbit.git

Due to an effort from Google to make BigQuery more difficult to use than it was previously (read as "enterprise-y"), it now requires a byzantine setup to run properly.  You'll need to create a service account and do some weirdness with keys.  

First off, you need to auth gcloud on your new VM by running:

    gcloud init

Now run this:

    SERVICE_ACCOUNT=downloader
    PROJECT_ID=arbit-prod
    gcloud iam service-accounts create ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
      --member "serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
      --role "roles/owner"
    gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}.key.json \
      --iam-account ${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com

You're also going to need to add this to the bottom of your .profile.  While we're at, it let's set the time zone to New York too.

    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/downloader.key.json
    TZ='America/New_York'; export TZ

Finally, do this to make sure the values are picked up:

    sudo reboot
